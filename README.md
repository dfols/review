# Web Development Class Website

This repository contains the source code for the website used in our web
development class. The website serves as both an example and a guide for the
topics covered during the first few weeks of the class, focusing on HTML and
CSS.

## Overview

The website consists of several pages, each focusing on a specific topic:

- `index.html` - The homepage, providing an overview of the course content.
- `html.html` - A page focusing on HTML elements and structure, from basic tags
  to forms and inputs.
- `border-box.html` - A page dedicated to the CSS box model, including margin,
  padding, and border.
- `grid.html` - A page covering the CSS grid layout system.
- `flexbox.html` - A page demonstrating the CSS flexbox layout system.

Each page includes a corresponding CSS file for styling.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open any of the `.html` files in a web browser to view the website.

## Code Structure

Each HTML file is structured according to semantic HTML principles and includes
a navigation bar for easy access to other pages. The CSS for each page
demonstrates the concepts covered on that page.
